## Getting-and-cleaning-data-Assignment

### Objective

This assignment is about collecting, working with and cleaning a data set. There are four files that are required to document the processing of raw data:
* README.md - general info about the assignment
* CodeBook.md - a detailed and clear document describing the variables (& units) and actions required to process the data
* run_analysis.R - a R script that downloads the data and creates the final tidy data set
* tidy.txt - the final tidy data set.

### Motivation
Personal wearable technologies are leading to an explosion of available data that companies such as fitbit, Nike, Jawbone etc. are racing to utilize and get the edge in competition. We focus on data derived from an acceleromter from a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone corresponding to activities such as walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying. More information about the data set is available at the website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

### Source
The zip file containing the data from the website: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip contains test and training sets using which we have to complete objective.
